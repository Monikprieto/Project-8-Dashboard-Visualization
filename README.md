# Flight Delays Analysis – EDA & Power BI Dashboard

##  Introduction
This repository showcases a data analysis project focused on flight delays in the United States. It covers dataset cleaning using Python, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a final Power BI dashboard for visualization.
---

## Dataset Description
- **Source:** U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics
- **Key Fields:** Year, Month, Carrier, Airport, Delay Types, Arrival Flights, etc.
- **Goal:** Identify major delay causes and patterns across airlines and airports.
---

## Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- PostgreSQL (optional)
- Power BI
---

## Procedure Overview
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and remove rows with >50% nulls.
2. **EDA:** Analyze delay causes and trends by carrier, airport, and time.
3. **Dashboard:** Build an interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs and visual filters.
---

## Results and Insights
- Late aircraft and NAS delays dominate most of the cases.
- Delay patterns vary significantly by airline and season.
- Power BI enables dynamic filtering and business-focused visuals.
